A *very experimental* Fediverse server for microblogging/"toots". Not fully functional yet - I'm still working on making all the basic bits work!

Goals:

* Can run on serverless hosting
* Multiple account domains possible per server
* Mastodon client API compatible
* Async evented core for fan-out/delivery


## Deployment

### Requirements:

- **Python** 3.11
- **Postgresql** 14+
- **Lots of patience** This is *very experimental*
